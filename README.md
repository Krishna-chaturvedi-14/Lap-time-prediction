# Lap-time-prediction
This project was built as part of the burnout competition 2025, where the objective was to predict the lap time (Lap_Time_Seconds) for racing drivers under various burnout conditions. The challenge involved handling a large-scale regression dataset with over 1.9 million rows and multiple categorical and numerical features.
